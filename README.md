# :sparkles: Web_Design Assignment :sparkles:

## Introduction

This is my Web Design Project for Fadipe Designs.
As part of the assignment I had to create a responsive website.
I created this website using `Visual Studio Code`.
The responsive website is a mock portfolio website which will be a one page HTML.

## Step to Build/Compile Website Assesets
I will be using Joe Appleton's `Vue`, `Webpack` and  repo which will compile the `SASS`.
Everything will be compiled in the `bundle.js`file.
I used `npm run watch`  to watch the webpack.

I converted CSS to SCSS syntax using the website [Here](http://sebastianpontow.de/css2compass/).

Once I converted the CSS into SCSS, I put everything in their respective folders and files within the SASS folder. e.g. All the colours in the sass/base/color.scss
## Coding Standards

### HTML Coding Standard
The coding standard I used for HTML is the HTML5 syntax which can be found here from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp).

### SASS Coding Standard
The coding standard I used for SASS was the SCSS syntax aka Sassy CSS, which can be found in the official SASS guide [here](https://sass-lang.com/guide)

SCSS is fully compilant with CSS syntax.

To structure
Link to SASS file stucture which is 7-1 pattern (which I changed slightly) https://www.sitepoint.com/architecture-sass-project/ and  http://vanseodesign.com/css/sass-directory-structures/

## Git Branching Strategy
I will be using my version of Git Flow as my branching strategy. The original Git Flow can be found [here](http://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html)
